Prototype Google Sheets API for running D&amp;D games via Slack

The bot is accessed using slash commands in a Slack chat. The bot reads and updates Google Sheets containing various character stats, simulates dice rolls, and returns a message containing the results of the requested action. I created this for a text-based D&D campaign being played by some friends.
